// This file contains the proto libraries, python script and genrule required for FHIR structural
// validation of PHR medical data.
// The python script generate_fhir_spec.py reads in the FHIR spec json files published by FHIR
// (located in the android external folder). The official spec is then used to generate a fhirspec
// proto message that is written to "fhirspec-r4.binarypb". This file is then added to
// java_resources of the HC service to be used for the validation of incoming FHIR resources,
// specifically in the FhirSpecProvider class.
